# Chat App -> a real time chat application

This repo was created to help users Dockerize an application that utilizes HTTP and WebSocket communication protocols.

The app is a simple chat application that is built using React (front-end), Flask (back-end REST), Flask (back-end WebSocket), and PostgreSQL (db). All four of these services are then containerized using Docker.

The chat app gets all historical messages on rendering of the page. Posts new messages to the database when a user submits the message. And also updates the messages posted in real-time to all the users.

**Client:** ReactJS, JavaScript, socket.io

**Server:** Python, Flask, Flask-RESTx, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, flask-socketio

**Database:** PostgreSQL

**Other:** Docker

# Configuring the repo for the first time and running application

## Docker

To be able to run this project you will need Docker Desktop installed on your computer. Docker installation instructions: `https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/`

The instructions below will allow you to run this project on your local computer using **docker-compose**

1. Run the following command in the terminal to download a copy of the repo to your local machine

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/adrianhuber17/chat-app.git
```

- Navigate into the new sub-folder created called **chat-app**.
- Run the following commands to create an environment and install the dependencies:

2. After the project repo is downloaded navigate into the project directory

```bash
  cd chat-app
```

3. Manually open Docker desktop or run the command below to open Docker

```bash
 open -a Docker
```

4. Once the Docker desktop is runnning, type the command below to create and start the container in detached mode and build the image

```bash
  docker-compose up -d --build
```

At this point the container with the app should be running in your local computer

Services are running on **Port 3000** (front-end React), **Port 5001** (back-end REST), **Port 5004** (back-end WebSocket). Please make sure you have no other app running on these ports

Open a browser to the local host **http://localhost:3000/** and start enjoying the app.

# Demo

## Endpoints
